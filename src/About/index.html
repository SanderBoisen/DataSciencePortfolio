                  I identify as a botanist first and formost, but most of the time I work with data analysis and exploration.
                  As a scientist my main interest is the interplay between evolution and ecology. On a practical level the thing
                  that really gets me going is writing code to solve problems. I am always looking for new things to solve, calculate,
                  plot and disappear into. Disappear is a good word for what happens when I get in contact with a new analytic task:
                  I find myself disappearing into the project, diving straight into the deep end and enjoy the swim. Pardon the pictoresque discription, but I am
                  highly enthusiastic about this topic. I think my three best qualities are:

                  <li>I am creative</li>
                  <li>I am a fast learner</li>
                  <li>I am passionate about data science </li>

                 This portfolio and website is a testimony to my ability to learn and creative approach. Before this, I had zero experience with HTML, CSS, and
                 using github for building websites. I have learned as I went and solved problems idependently. I am a highly independent worker, but I my
                 eyes are opening to the advantages of collaborations.

                 I believe that learning is a skill, and I have spent quite a bit of time developing that skill.
                 I am confident that I can learn whatever is necessary to make valuable contributions to any project.
                 Unless it is on German grammar, that stuff is hard.

                 Feel free to contact me for an informal exchange any time.
                 I am interested in both academic collaborations and applied data science.

                 Looking forward to hearing from you,
                 Sander
